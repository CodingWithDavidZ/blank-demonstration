# About

This site is created to SIMULATE a possible issue when using target='\_blank' without using rel='noreferrer'. For saftey reasons, all vulnerable href used in this code does use rel='noreferrer' and the result is simulated instead.

# How to use

Open the site, follow the directions and links. When you click on the Phishing one, you will get a new tab just like using target='\_blank' would cause but when you go back to the original tab, you will get a surprise.
